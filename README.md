SharedPreferences is recommended for storing small amounts of persistent data within an app. 
It is a lightweight and simple solution for saving key-value pairs, such as user settings or preferences. 
Unlike databases, which are better suited for handling large or complex data, SharedPreferences provides a hassle-free way to store lightweight information. 
However, it is not ideal for storing large datasets or structured data.
